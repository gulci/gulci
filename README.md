# gulci[^1]

I love engineering and developing the frontends and backends of modern web applications.

I currently work for [Section](https://section.io), where I'm involved in creating the best platform for deploying and managing intelligently distributed workloads in the cloud.

In the past, I have worked for [CovalentCreative](https://covalentcreative.com), where I created a real-time virtual events platform, and [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu), where I helped develop the UCSD mobile app.

I enjoy amateur astrophotography, gaming, and my Mazda Miata.
