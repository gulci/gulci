# gulci[^1]

I love engineering and developing the frontends and backends of modern web applications.

In the past, I have worked for [Section](https://section.io), where I was involved in creating a platform for deploying and managing intelligently distributed Kubernetes workloads in the cloud. I also worked for [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu), where I helped develop the UCSD mobile app.

I currently work for [CovalentCreative](https://covalentcreative.com), where I work on the best online education and events platforms for eyecare professionals.

I enjoy amateur astrophotography, gaming, and my Mazda Miata.
